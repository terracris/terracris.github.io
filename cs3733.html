        <h3 style="text-align: left">Description</h3>
        <p>For this project, we worked to develop a desktop application for Mass General Brigham Hospital employees to
          access and use. The application focuses on creating and carrying out service requests, such as food, gift, and
          medical
          deliveries, as well as laundry and transportation services. Additionally, a database of locations, medical
          equipment,
          medical equipment service requests, and employees is maintained and implemented in an easy-to-use graphical
          interface.
          We also implemented computer vision and a couple classic games.

          The Medical Service Web Application was designed to assist medical professionals by making the process of
          making and
          carrying out service requests streamlined and easy to use.
          By including these features alongside a few delighter features, this application aims to make the lives of
          healthcare
          workers easier.</p>

        <img class="image fit" src="cs3733/ui3.png" />

        <p>I collaborated within a dynamic team of 9 developers to bring to fruition a desktop application tailored for
          Mass
          General Brigham Hospital employees. Employing the Agile Scrum methodology, our approach was structured,
          iterative, and
          collaborative. Administrative tasks were efficiently managed through tools such as Trello, Slack, and Google
          Drive,
          ensuring seamless communication and project organization. Daily scrums were conducted to keep the team
          aligned, and
          sprint expectations were diligently maintained.

          <br />
          <br />
          My title was Software Feature Engineer. My primary focus within this multifaceted project was UI design and
          feature integration. We
          aimed to create an intuitive and
          user-friendly
          graphical interface to enhance the overall experience for healthcare professionals. The application's
          user-centric
          design aimed to streamline service requests, making it more accessible for medical professionals to navigate
          and utilize
          effectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          In terms of technology, we utilized JavaFX and Scene Builder for writing the desktop application. This choice
          allowed us
          to develop a visually appealing and responsive UI. Additionally, we implemented a range of databases,
          including
          embedded, client, and remote databases, to efficiently manage data related to locations, medical equipment,
          service
          requests, and employees.
          <br />
          <br />
          To ensure robust software architecture, we incorporated various design patterns such as the Singleton pattern
          and
          others. These patterns enhanced the scalability, maintainability, and overall structure of our application.

          For those interested in exploring the intricacies of our application, we have a user guide available. It
          provides a
          comprehensive overview of the features, functionalities, and best practices for utilizing the system
          effectively. The
          guide serves as a valuable resource for users to get acquainted with the application's capabilities and make
          the most
          out of its offerings. <a

            a look!</a>
          <br />
          <br />
          Our collaborative effort, adherence to best practices, and focus on user experience collectively contributed
          to the
          successful development of a desktop application that not only meets the practical needs of healthcare
          professionals but
          also integrates innovative features like computer vision and classic games for a well-rounded user
          experience.

        <h3 style="text-align: left">What did I learn?</h3>
        <p>
          This project stands out as one of the most challenging endeavors I've undertaken, making it quite a feat to
          encapsulate
          its complexity and the sense of accomplishment it brought. It's truly impossible to fully convey the
          intricacies and
          rewards embedded in this experience. If anything, I might even jest that I learned a tad too much, but it's
          all in good
          humor.

          <br />
          <br />

          Navigating the terrain of this project illuminated the essence of working within a large team to achieve a
          shared goal.
          Each team member emerged as an invaluable resource, contributing diverse knowledge that became instrumental in
          overcoming the project's challenges. The collaborative effort demonstrated that the strength of a team lies in
          the
          collective expertise of its individuals.
<br />
<br />
          In the realm of software development, this project was a learning ground for various design patterns. It
          instilled in me
          a heightened awareness of the significance of thoughtful design decisions when crafting applications. My
          journey also
          deepened my familiarity with Java and its applications in developing desktop solutions, broadening my skill
          set in the
          process.
<br />
<br />
          However, the lessons extended beyond coding and design. A newfound understanding of creating an optimal work
          environment
          and considering the perspectives of fellow developers emerged. Discovering a passion for teaching and
          assisting others
          in debugging programs became an unexpected but welcome revelation. This project underscored the importance of
          a
          collaborative and supportive atmosphere within a development team.

          Furthermore, as I delved into perfecting the user interface, a significant portion of my time was devoted to
          ensuring
          its cohesiveness, responsiveness, structure, and adaptability. This not only contributed to the visual appeal
          but also
          facilitated ease of modification for other developers, promoting a seamless collaborative development process.

          Reflecting on this journey, it became evident that my interests have expanded towards backend systems. The
          desire to
          delve deeper into this realm emerged as a key takeaway, opening new avenues for future exploration and growth.

          In essence, this project was a crucible of challenges and triumphs, offering a rich tapestry of experiences
          that shaped
          not only my technical skills but also my approach towards teamwork, design considerations, and personal
          aspirations in
          the realm of software development.
