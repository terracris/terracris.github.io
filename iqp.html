          <h2>Co-creating Nature Based Solutions in Divjaka, Albania</h2>
        </header>
        <img style="max-height: 50%;" src="iqp/erosion.jpg" />
        <h3 style="text-align: left">Description</h3>

        <p>This project was an environmental project, where I and three other students
          collaboratively discovered and created solutions incorporating nature to mitigate soil erosion of precious
          watersheds in Albania (abroad). Our project was a part of a grant formulated by a German Governmental
          Organization called GIZ that provides aid to other countries. The regional watershed, which includes the
          Karavasta lagoon within the park,
          and the Shkumbini River along
          the northern
          border of the Karavasta National Park, provides important resources to the people living there. Fishermen will
          fish throughout
          the lagoon,
          farmers work the land near the river, and tourists come to visit the beaches and uncommon birds that can be
          found there.
          All these groups are being affected by erosion and drought. Coastal erosion creates blockages in the lagoon's
          channels,
          reducing or destroying communication with the sea. This leads to decreased oxygen levels and increased
          salinity within
          the lagoon's waters, harming fish populations, which in turn harms fishermen and birds. Riparian erosion
          destroys
          farmland and intensifies flooding.
          Because of the hazards around Divjaka, GIZ is interested in creating a few NbS that could have a positive
          holistic
          effect on the region. They also want these NbS to be designed in such a way that they could potentially be
          implemented
          elsewhere at a later point in time, with minimal modifications. GIZ's past work in Albania has included
          ecosystem-based
          adaptation projects in Elbasan, and flood mitigation plans in Shkoder.
        </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left">Execution</h3>
        <p>So where did we start? My team and I did some preliminary research on the hazards present in Divjaka, Albania
          before being physically on sight. Once we arrived to Albania we had several semi-structured interviews with
          Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Government Organizations, Municipalities, Fishermen Organizations and
          Farmers.

          <br />
          <br />

          From these dialogues, we were able to piece together the story of what was occuring in Divjaka and how these
          groups would
          solve these issues using nature. Additionally, we held workshops with both High School & University students
          from the University of Tirana to illicit more ideas.

        <img class="image fit" src="iqp/activity.jpg" />
        <img class="image fit" src="iqp/lagoon_timelapse.png" />

        <p>So what was the story? Apperantly, over years, the current of the Shkumbini river was eroding the river bed.
          The eroded sediments were depositing onto the basin of the lagoon facing the adriatic sea. Why was this a
          problem?
          The Karavasta Lagoon had channels connecting it to the Adriatic sea which were now being clogged by the
          deposited sediments.
          Lagoons contain brakish water, that is, a mixture of freshwater and salt water. If the channels are blocked,
          Albania's
          hot summers will result in evaporation of the water increasing salinity levels. This is detrimental to
          wildlife present in the area.
          This has resulted in a decrease in the population of fish affecting the livelihoods of fishermen. In addition,
          the loss of
          land to farmers along the river has decreased their yields significantly, again, affecting their livelihood.
          You can see
          in the timelapse the progressive deposition of sediments and the change in the shape of the watershed.

        <img class="image fit" src="iqp/rockarmor.png" />

        <p>As a result of our dialogues and activities, we collaboratively designed nature based solutions using
          reparian forest buffers, rock armor, and vegetation/shrubbery along the river bed. A reparian forest buffer
          is a segment of trees placed along the river bed. The roots from the trees help reinforce the river bed and
          act as a buffer for strong currents and floods. Lining the bed of the river with rocks decreases stream
          velocity
          minimizing eroding. Additionally, if we planted vegetation below the rock armor that would anchor sediments
          resulting
          in additional fortification.
        </p>

        <img class="image fit" src="iqp/transect_walk.jpg" />

        <p>We conducted a transect walk along the river with a local farmer to discover where we should place our nature
          based solutions.</p>

        <img class="image fit" src="iqp/placements_both.png" />
        <img class="image fit" src="iqp/rfb_placement.png" />
        <img class="image fit" src="iqp/tree.png" />

        <p>From our transect walk, we discovered the locations that would be ideal to place these interventions. We also
          were able to uncover what tree we should use for the Riparian Forest Buffer. The Stone Pine Tree is an
          excellent choice since it has a natural resistance to environments with a moderate-high salinity.
        </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left">What did I learn?</h3>
        <p>Everyone is an expert in their field after enough time doing it. We noticed that there was no difference in
          discussion between the fishermen and members of government organizations. The fishermen in fact had more
          knowledge about the state of the lagoon and additional ideas of how to address the issues at hand. In
          addition,
          I learned how to talk with various stakeholders and facilitate discussions to illicit stakeholder needs
          and requirements. Lastly, I have learned about generating designs using nature. Lastly, I learned about the
          hospitality of Albanian culture. Albanian's are extremely welcoming and I would highly encourage visiting! If
          you
          know even a few Albanian phrases, they will love you! I found myself learning a decent amount of Albanian to
          hold a
          light conversation. </p>
