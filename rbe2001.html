          <h3 style="text-align: left">Description</h3>
          <p>
            The final project task is to simulate robots tasked with replacement
            of solar collector panels on planet with two suns. There will be two
            types of solar collectors mounted at two different angles (see image
            below). On each side of the solar farm roof there will be an old
            solar panel. Teams will be required to have at least two different
            robots with different fourbar designs, one with a regular
            servo-actuated gripper, and one with a continuous rotation
            servo-actuated gripper. <br />
            <br />

            The first robot will need to autonomously remove an old panel and
            place it on the staging block. The old panel will be replaced with a
            new panel, which the robot will pick up and place it on the empty
            spot on the roof. The first robot will then need to move to the
            other side of the field and start line following as if to pick up
            the old panel from the other side of the roof. The team will pause
            the first robot with the IR remote and replace it with the second
            robot in the same position. The second robot will proceed to remove
            the old panel and replace it with a new panel.

          <h3 style="text-align: left">Execution</h3>
          <p>
            In our robotics project, we utilized a differential drive robot, 
			specifically the Pololu Romi, and were tasked with the development 
			of two four-bar linkages and grippers. Let's delve into the process 
			of synthesizing a four-bar linkage for a gripper.
          </p>

          <h4>Four-bar Synthesis</h4>
          <img src="rbe2001/gripper_synthesis_pt1.JPG" alt="" />
          <p>
            We commenced our four-bar synthesis by taking inspiration from an initial 
			gripper design. The first step involved identifying three crucial points of 
			contact essential for effectively grasping a "solar panel" or plate. Notably, 
			the attachment points on the right-hand side of the gripper served as the connection points 
			between the gripper and the four-bar mechanism. Additionally, we considered a 
			fixed point on the gripper, where the "solar panel" would come into contact, as 
			a universal point in our four-bar analysis. This universal point remained consistent 
			regardless of the gripper's orientation, leading us to disregard the dynamic bottom jaw 
			whose position wasn't absolute.
          </p>
          <img src="rbe2001/gripper_synthesis_pt2.JPG" />
          <p>
            Illustrated below are three desired positions for our gripper or coupler. 
			Ensuring that our gripper achieves these positions necessitates the use of 
			Three-Position Synthesis to design our four-bar linkage.
          </p>
          
		  <p>
            Now, let me guide you through the synthesis process for a four-bar linkage with three desired coupler positions using a simplified diagram.

			<ol>
				<li><p>Begin by drawing displacement vectors between points A1 and A2, A2 and A3, B1 and B2, and B2 and B3.</p></li>
				<li><p>Identify the midpoint of each displacement vector: A1A2, A2A3, B1B2, and B2B3.</p></li>
				<li><p>Draw perpendicular bisectors for each midpoint. The first ground joint, referred to as O2, is located at the intersection of the A1A2 and A1A3 bisector. Similarly, the second ground joint, referred to as O4, is located at the intersection of the B1B2 and B2B3 bisector.</p></li>
				<li><p>Connect O2 to A1 and O4 to B1 with links.</p></li>
				<li><p>Once all links are drawn, the synthesis of the four-bar mechanism is complete.</p></li>
			</ol>

          </p>
          <img class="image fit" src="rbe2001/gripper_synthesis_pt4.JPG" />

		  <p>The image below is what our diagram looked like. The lower green circle represents A1, whereas the green one above represents B1. The magenta lines 
			represent the perpendicular bisectors for distance vectors A1A2 and A2A3. The blue lines represent the perpendicular bisectors for distance vectors B1B2 Additionally B2B3. 
			The red circles represent the ground joints found. The red lines symbolize the links connecting the ground joints to A1 and B1. From this sketch, we found the required link lengths
			for our four bar mechanism.

       <img class="image fit" src="rbe2001/exploded_view.png"/>

       <p>Behold! This is our robot Duncan (named after Dunkin Donuts)</p>
       <p>Our robot features a two-stage transmission system</p>

       <h3 style="text-align: left;">Autonomous Control</h3>
       <img class="image fit" src="rbe2001/Sensors.png">

      <p>Our robot autonomously navigated the field using various sensors. We used the following:
        <ol style="text-align: left;">
          <li>Ultrasonic Sensors</li>
          <li>Reflactance Sensors</li>
          <li>Magnetic Encoders</li>
          <li>Infrared Receiver</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>Our Reflactance sensors were used for line following whereas our ultrasonic sensors were used to ensure we were at the optimum distance
        from the structures to collect the solar panels and validate our positioning.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: left;"> What did I learn?</h3>
      <p>In this project, I developed my skills in mechanical design. I learned about how to synthesize a four bar mechanism for applications that require 
        control of several positions within one degree of freedom. 

        I learned about toggle points, transmission angles, and mechanical advantage to improve my designs. 

        Most importantly, I learned about the limitations of 3d printed materials to widstand stress and levergage the properties of 3d printed materials
        to maximize their strength while minimizing its weight. 

        Lastly, I learned about the significance of center of mass. The center of mass our four bar attachment, was infront of the center of mass of our robot. 
        This resulted in wheel slipping increasing the error in our odometry, tipping if a counterweight was not added, and increased the power requirements of our motors
        for locomotion. If my team and I had more time, we would design our components to ensure that the center of mass remains as close to the center as possible. 

        I learned about state machines and timer interrupts to infrared sensors to disrupt the execution of code and jump to a different state in the state machine.
